"""
This is an implementation of BFS in graphs.
Pass a graph as a dictionary, where the keys are nodes and the
values are lists of neighbors (only the neighbors 'below' are needed).
Note that this is not really a search, but merely a traversal through the whole graph
in order to visualize the algorithm.
The search itself can be added easily by checking whether the current node is the target.

    # as opposed to O(1) for sets (and dictionaries?).
